                        <p>Since March, we have been working closely with staff, schools, parents, considering the requirements and guidelines open to us, and we plan to re-open the clubs from September 2020.</p>

                    <h1>Register</h1>
                    <p>If your child attends Mortimer St Mary’s, Mortimer St John’s or Burghfield St Mary’s, you can register at any time for a place 
                        within our clubs.  You can either register for regular sessions, or for one-off sessions as and when these are available.  While 
                        our clubs are busy, we do have some availability and operate a waiting list where necessary.  It is always working discussing 
                        with us what you need, and we will offer you a place or keep you on the waiting list for places as they become available.
                        <br>We aim to send out registration forms to new school joiners in around June for a September start.
                        <br><br>The Oaks Registration Pack is available to download
